                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In times of the corona crisis you can hear everyone saying: we are not allowed to do anything anymore, everything has been canceled, life has come to a standstill. But are we really standing still? Maybe it is not a standstill, but an opportunity for progress. Real progress.
<br><br>The corona crisis has accelerated the development of the digital world and the society enormously and brought it to a climax. Within a year we have reached the point where we would otherwise have taken several years. But this acceleration and climax show us the change of society much more clearly than if we were slowly included in it. Because do we want to continue with this increasingly fast and demanding society? People are flexible and can adapt extremely well. But where is the limit? How long can we handle this speed, or more accurately: how much more can we accelerate? Will we continue to stretch? Do we snap at a certain point in time? Or will we let ourselves go; we will say: and now it is enough, we no longer want to live like that.
<br><br>Because this exceptional living and work situation in this corona crisis, is the 'normal' life we ​​are heading for if we do nothing about the situation of an accelerating society.
<br><br>After all, we were already on the way to an almost entire digital world, in which interaction only has to be fast and effective. The interaction and being together that we now so consciously miss. A society in which new technological developments are constantly being found to allow us to keep up with the fast life. However, these technological developments only ensure that everything can and must be done even faster. This accelerating society is partly fueled by our sense of competition and the idea that we have to get the most out of our lives.&nbsp;<br><br>The idea that we should get the most out of our lives is the source of the idea that our lives would stand still in the corona crisis. Students are at home, everything happens behind a screen. They do not meet new people and cannot develop in new climates they are in. They cannot build their future lives, while they "should" in this period of life. They are lagging behind in their own lives.&nbsp;<br><br>However, this feeling of stagnation and lag is precisely one of the characteristics of the vicious circle of acceleration that we want to break. Having an extensive network, a start to a promising career, a relationship, your own home own and a well-stocked savings account before the age of thirty are all characteristics of that ever-accelerating society in which you have to get the most out of life. If we get out of this, all of that would be no longer necessary. Then the 'silence' or time that we are now experiencing in this crisis will offer plenty of opportunities.&nbsp;<br><br>We have the opportunity to develop ourselves. Not in terms of: get everything out of it to make it, but to get to know yourself. The standstill provides the opportunity for self-development. It provides the opportunity to break through expectations. Individual development can ultimately lead to the development of the collective, the development of the greater whole with which we can together form a society that is good for everyone.<br></p>
