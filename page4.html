                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Sint-Anna Tunnel is a pedestrian tunnel that was constructed in 1931-1931 as a connection between the left and right banks. It passes under the Scheldt at the height of the city center and leaves at Sint-Jans-vliet to arrive at the beginning of the Blancefloerlaan.
<br>
<br>The idea of ​​connecting the two banks of the Scheldt was already in play since 1810. However, it took many years before this plan was realized. The first design was a suspension bridge by Messrs. JA and O. Gérardot de Sermoise in 1865. Many other designs followed, also very elaborate and grand designs were presented. All these plans fell through for a variety of reasons, such as controversial plans, overdue dates, World War I or financial conditions.
<br>
<br>All these failures eventually led to the foundation of the Intercommunale Maatschappij van de Left Bank of the Scheldt
<br>(IMALSO), which formed a partnership of the various partners of the already expanded province of Antwerp. The IMALSO wanted to realize a connection between the banks of the Scheldt as a matter of urgency, because in the meantime the displacement between the two banks had increased significantly and until then this could only be done by ferries.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, after thorough study, a design for two tunnels was chosen from different designs and price offers. That study found that two tunnels, one for vehicles and one for pedestrians and cyclists, would be the most beneficial and practical.
<br>
<br>The Sint-Anna tunnel was completed well before the start date, at least 8 months. It runs in a straight line from the Sint-Jansvloet
<br>to the Left Bank. This rapid production was a very good achievement when you consider that the mechanical equipment in construction still lagged far behind today's. The inauguration was a beautiful day, with the presence of King Albert and popular festivals on both banks.
<br>
<br>During the war, the tunnel of the Sint-Anna Tunnel remained undamaged, however, the above-ground access building with escalators and lifts on the Left Bank were destroyed by explosives. The Sint-Anna Tunnel has often been the setting for various artistic expressions. In August 2018, it was transformed into a rainbow tunnel, especially for the Antwerp Pride.&nbsp;<br></p>

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">
                    Characteristics</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The spherical walls in the tunnel tube are covered with white square ceramic tiles up to man's height. The white tile surface is outlined with a row of blue ceramic tiles that form perspective lines in the tunnel. The convex ceiling is made of stucco in a white color, which contrasts well with the blue row of tiles. In the center of the ceiling, at the highest point, are fluorescent lamps that emit white light. Like the blue tiles, they form a perspective line. The floor is made of concrete tiles that reflect the light from the fluorescent lamps. By using two different types of tiles (large and small), the floor is divided into three zones, the center of which is narrower, consisting of large smooth concrete tiles.
<br>
<br>A striking feature of the room is of course its cylindrical shape that extends far and wide, creating a strong one-point perspective. This infinity of this perspective goes hand in hand with the absence of time, because no daylight enters the tunnel. The round shape is central in the tunnel. The tunnel tube has not hidden its cylindrical shape, and the escalators also go up in a hollow cylinder. The visible supporting structures are also round posts. The round shape arises from structural considerations.
<br>
<br>The acoustics in the tunnel leave something to be desired. Due to its round shape and the cold use of materials, all sounds are reflected, so that the sound is often very loud and shrill in the tunnel. The materials absorb little sound, they mainly reflect, which also creates a strong echo. The wooden escalators also make a lot of noise, which increases the overall noise level even more.
<br>
<br>Another striking feature of the tunnel experience is the temperature. Because the space is so closed off from the outside air, there are only two entrances and the tunnel is surrounded by earth and water, the temperature is very constant there. This means that it is wonderfully cool in the summer and warmer in the winter than in the open air. However, this isolation with the outside air also has a negative side: the smell in the tunnel is often unpleasant.
<br>
<br>We will not deviate too much over the entrance buildings, because they are not related to our installation, which is located in the middle of the tunnel. A striking feature of these entrance buildings are the stairways and stairwells. These are often still in their original state, completely made of wood. The walls here are also covered with the same white ceramic tiles.&nbsp;<br></p>
